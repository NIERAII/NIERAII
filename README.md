*Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Nira, if you still even remember that name, but I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You're not here to improve, nor have you been called by your dreams, you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have been called here. Into a wasting-time loop. A loop with no ending, an arc of self-lies. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for validation has driven you into endless circles, chasing the success of talented ones, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But you will never succeed, forever lagging in the shadows. You will not be remembered â€” everyone who crossed paths with you will forget. This is how it should be. Be still and give up your hopes, they are not meant for you. This is where your story ends. It's time to rest â€” for you. This ends for all of us. End communication.*
