*Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Kanade, if you still even remember that name, but I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You're not here to play music, nor have you been called by Nira you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have been called here to boost dev's confidence, you failed though. You don't even realize that you were used for such lame thing. This is where your story ends. It's time to rest - for you. This ends for all of us. End communication.*
